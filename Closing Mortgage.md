The money will be removed from my account on **November 7th**.

I have 60 days to cancel the mortgage. I do this in the nearest conservatory (Cascais Civil Registry) or online. When the amount is paid, I will receive a **code** at my email. With this code, I get the mortgage cancellation confirmation. All the **instructions on obtaining the document will be in the email**. If I need help or have any questions, I can call ActivoBank.

**Questions**:
* What about the next installment?
	* The value of the next installment is already deducted
* What about insurances that I bought as a requirement for the mortgage?
	* House insurance (Multiriscos) is not cancelled automatically. I need to do this explicitly. It seems that I need to have 1  house insurance, so I cannot technically just cancel it - I would need to choose a new one to replace it.
	* Life insurance is cancelled automatically by ActivoBank.
