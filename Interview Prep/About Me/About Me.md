I currently work as an Engineering Manager at OLX Group.

My background is in software engineering. I started coding when I was 15 years old, and graduated in computer science. I also started working in the industry pretty early, during my university days. First some freelance projects, and then a full-time role at a company called Devtech. It is an outsorcing company which offers professional software development services to companies across the world. I spent 4 years there, working on various types of projects. After that I joined Richmond Group, where I was leading a team of engineers in one of their startups, and together with my team I managed to build the product from the early stage to going live.

By that time, I've already had experience in leading and mentoring engineers, and I've realized two things:
* Helping people grow; enabling them to become top performers, is one of the best feelings in the world.
* In order to deliver a great product, you need to have a high-performing team. I can make a much bigger impact by building a great team, than by doing it on my own.

So when I was presented with some leadership and people management opportunities, I was more than willing to embrace them. And that's when I started transitioning to an Engineering Manager role.

My next role was in Proctorio, an ed-tech startup from Arizona, where I was working as an Engineering Manager. There I helped the founder build an AI-based, online proctoring platform and scale it to more than 3M active users, as it has today.

And that brings us to my current role. I work as an Engineering Manager at OLX Group, where I am leading a team of engineers in the vehicles customer unit for the European markets. My team is responsible for the seller side of our user base accross our European platforms.

Outside of work, I like to play tennis and travel. I also like to do some coding in my free time, and stay up to date with the current state of technology.

This is essentially a “pitch”. It's your interviewer's first impression of you, so you want to be sure to nail this.
