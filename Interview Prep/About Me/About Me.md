I come from a technical background  - I’ve been coding since I was 15 and have a degree in Computer Science. Over the years, I’ve worked across a range of domains like FinTech, EdTech, and developer tooling, and in environments ranging from early-stage startups to large enterprises. Right now, I’m an Engineering Manager at Docker, where I lead the development of Docker Cloud - a SaaS platform that enables developers to build, run, and test their software seamlessly in the cloud.
