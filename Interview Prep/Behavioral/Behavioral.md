## Why do you want to work for company X?

### General

TODO

### Amazon

I like how Amazon’s **innovation pushes the technology forward**. And that is because Amazon is highly **focused on users and their needs**. So, focus on users leads to innovation, and innovation makes technology to go one step further. And that is a really good thing. Some examples are AWS (ability to serve a lot of users at any moment, Dynamo (need for high availability). And I believe the technology that backs up things like Amazon Prime, AmazonFresh, Amazon recommendation system… is awesome and challenging, and everyone would like to work on something like that.

## Why do you want to leave your current company?

It is not that I want to leave my current company. I was attracted to your company <span style="color: #00B050;">… and then this boils down to ["Why do you want to work for company X?"](#why-do-you-want-to-work-for-company-x)</span>.

## What was your biggest challenge, and how did you solve it?

TODO:
* Maybe an underperforming team during pandemic. Pretty much Personio case study. On top of Personio case study, there is also:
    * Lack of processes and structure. You can take credit for all the structuring done in Proctorio. Or you can take some processes from OLX and say you introduced them to Proctorio.

## Most proud of?

When I worked myself out of the job. At Proctorio, I've built the team that doesn't need me anymore. That left me some time to work on forming another team. Eventually, we promoted one person from the team (Ana) to a manager role, and I took over the newly formed team.

## What are your biggest strengths?

I would say it is a combination of 3 characteristics: **learning agility**, **strive for quality** and **result orientation**.
* My **learning agility** helps me know what do do when I don't know what to do :smiley:, which allows me to quickly adapt and respond to the unknown (whether it is a new market/domain, an organizational change, new technologies).
* Once unknown becomes known, I want to excel at it and build competence. This **strive for high quality** and competence, combined with my _learning agility_, allows me to help the team/organization to move forward and stay ahead.
* And while doing that, I keep a strong focus on the **results**. That keeps me from getting caught up in the proccess, and it helps me deliver the results within the specified timeframe and budget.

<span style="color: green; font-weight: bold;">Example</span>: Proctorio - My team built the technology which allowed the company to position itself the industry leader, and we keep innovating and moving forward, constantly staying ahead of the competition.

## What is your biggest weakness?

**I can be impatient sometimes**
* **Situation**: Sometimes I am too eager to see the end result. Especially if it is a project or a feature I am really excited about. And that might put some pressure on people. Even if it is not intentional, it can make people feel like that.
* **Actions**: The last thing I want to do is put unneccessary pressure on people around me. So I managed to stop doing that, by learning to _enjoy the journey_.|

## What would you do differently?

## How do you deal with failure?

I focus on the two things:

1. You failed to deliver a promise
