### Technical leader expectations
- **Partners**: How do you partner with cross-functional partners and stakeholders? What are some successful collaborations that you’ve had? Tell me how you’d design a client-server API to build a rich document editor
- **Resolves Conflict**: What kind of disagreements have you had with colleagues and/or team members? How have you resolved them? Can you empathize with people whose points of view differ radically from yours?
- **Grows Continuously**: Discuss a project that you led that failed. Why did it fail and what did you learn? Do you take constructive criticism as an opportunity to improve?
