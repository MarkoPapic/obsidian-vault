## People growth, coaching, development

1. **Identify** - What do we need to develop?
    * Strengths, weaknesses, challenges, opportunities
    * Aspirations
        * _Where do you want to be in 5m/1y/5y_?
        * _What skills do you need to get there?_ (maybe assess against the competence matrix)
        * _What does your team need from you to be successful? How are you meeting these needs today? How might you better fulfill those needs tomorrow?_
        * _How can I help?_
    * Company strategy
    * Look for the greatest value (ROI) - E.g. you may find it interesting to research best practices on internal communication systems, but improving communication between external customers and internal staff may produce a much higher return on investment by increasing client retention and sales.
2. Establish **goals & plan** (IDP)
    * Goals
        * _What are the most important activities you should be spending your time on right now? How do these activities create value?_
        * _What inhibits you from doing more of the things you believe you should be doing? How might you minimize non-productive work?_
    * Plan
        * 70:20:10
3. Execute
    * **Learn by doing** (with my support)
        * This is the major aspect of learning
        * I try to provide the environment which allows for developmental experiences.
        * I support them without removing responsibility
        * When defining goals, I think about whether those goals are  focused on fixed performance, or can they also be developmental experiences? Note: This is individual. What is a routine for someone, might be a challenge for someone else.
        * IDP question: “_What are two experiences in the next job you want to be in that you could try now?_”
        * **Delegation**
        * **Sponsoring** - enabling them to have those developmental experiences that I mentioned.
    * **Learn by failing**
        * Retrospectives - make every failure a developmental experience
    * Nurture a **growth mindset**
    * (if they ask) What does make an experience developmental:
        * Novel - getting out of routine.
        * Important
        * Diverse thinking - exposes the person to diverse ways of thinking, feeling and acting.
    * Learn by **interacting** with me
        * Observing them in action
        * Listening to them
        * Helping them
        * Providing feedback
    * Learn from **education**
        * The company provides plenty of materials
        * Conferences
4. **Evaluate and tweak**
    * It is a cyclic process

## Managing high performers

* Agree on the next position for that person (career trajectory)
* Growth plan - it is my (and company's) responsibility to provide them with an environment where they can make impact
	* Give them something to own
	* Challenges, stretch goals
	* Expand their influence: collaboration
	* Mentoring opportunities: allow them to duplicate themselves
* Keep them challenged, but avoid burnout
    * High performers tend to become "goto" people (e..g. other CUs pinging Tiago)
* Provide positive feedback/recognition (a proper feedback, not flattering)
* Find what motivates them
* Follow up regularly

## Managing conflict

* **Prevention**: establishing some norms and ground rules
    * Encourage debates. Make them a common thing rather than an exception
        * This will, over time, make people less likely to take criticism personally
    * Establish a norm where we focus on ideas, behaviors and impact - but not personalities
    * Establish a norm where debates are resolved by referencing facts, assumptions… not by power of the loudest voice
* **Observing without getting involved**
    * Disagreement: different ideas, approaches, or points of view can promote creativity and innovation. This is encouraged, people should not avoid disagreement and debate.
    * At this point I don't get involved, just stay alert in case I notice some signs like:
        * Disagreement shifted focus from task to personal
        * It is an ongoing disagreement and they are failing to reach the conclusion
* **Recognize** the warning signs of escalation
    * Focus on personalities
    * Poor communication
    * Pointed disagreements
    * Lack of openness
    * Negative body language
    * Dissatisfaction
    * Increased stress
    * Inflamatory words or actions
* **Address early**: I believe it is important to address the conflict as soon as it stops being constructive (as soon as I notice those warning signs I mentioned). When I address the conflict:
    * I try to avoid mediation at first, and try to help them to use their skills to resolve the conflict on their own.
    * And I only become a mediator if they are not able to resolve it or don't have the neccessary skills to do so
* **Coaching** people on how to resolve the conflict. I try to encourage them to take the ownership of the conflict, and help them come up with ideas and a plan for resolving the conflict. So I am mostly asking questions, and only give advise if needed (if they don't have the necessary skills to resolve the conflict)
    1. **Open** - identify the conflict and its impact.
        * Describe the purpose of our discussion, and importance.
            * _Hey, I've noticed that you and (name) don't communicate much in our recent meetings. And that concerns because this is starting to have a negative impact on our brainstorming sessions. If you don't exchange ideas, we might end up making a decision that is not optimal._
    2. **Clarify** causes of conflict
        * Ask them about the root cause.
        * Also show empathy with how they feel about this conflict
            * _What do you think is the root cause of this situation, and how are you feeling about it?_
            * _You fell like your ideas are being ignored. That has to be frustrating._
        * Focus on behaviors, ideas, impact... - not personalities
            * _What exactly in (name's) behavior makes you feel that way? What are the examples of (name's) behaviors?_
            * _What assumptions are you making, and how can you challenge them?_
        * Connect to a shared goal
            * _What goals or objectives do you and (name) share, and how would you describe them?_
            * _What are the potential benefits in how you and (name) are different?_
        * Help them try to understand the other person's perspective
            * _If you were looking at this situation from (name’s) perspective, what would you see? How might you feel?_
            * _How might you be contributing to this conflict?_
    3. Help **develop** ideas for resolving the conflict
        * By asking questions
        * Contribute ideas if needed
            * _How would you define a win-win in this situation?_
            * _If you could do one thing to resolve this conflict, what would it be?_
            * _How might you involve (name) in resolving this situation?_
            * _How would (name) feel about or react to this solution? How might you respond?_
            * _What might you say to acknowledge the other person’s point of view and feelings?_
            * _What would be the positive and negative consequences of taking this action? What would be the consequences of taking no action?)_
            * **_What resources/support can I provide?_**
    4. **Commit to action**
        * Create a plan for resolving the conflict
        * Specify how to track progress and measure results
    5. **Close**
        * Summarize the plan
        * Confirm understanding
        * Express confidence in their skills to resolve this conflict
        * Confirm committment
* **Mediation** - if conflict is still unresolved or starts causing damage
    * Set ground rules
        * Ask the people involved to agree on some do’s and don’ts for how they will treat each other during the discussion to ensure it is constructive.
    * Stay neutral, objective and unbiased
        * Stay focused on the facts
        * Empathize without agreeing
        * Check frequently for mutual understanding
    * Encourage everyone's involvement
        * Give everyone equal time to express themselves
        * Encourage people to restate the other person’s perspective to confirm understanding before moving on.
    * Connect everyone to a shared goal
    * Help people take ownership for resolving the conflict
        * Make it clear that your role is to help them discuss their differences constructively and that it is their responsibility to resolve the conflict.
        * Contribute ideas


BONUS: What about **zero-sum** conflicts?
* Transform conflict into a negotiation.
    * By adding other issues to negotiation and making trade-offs across those issues.
    * People can value various issues differently.
    * _“I will do this for you if you do such-and-such for me”_

# Hiring and team building

## How do you recruit good engineers?

1. **Principle (hiring) philosophy**:
	- Hire above the bar: Someone who will elevate the team, not just fit in
	- Hire for long-term: Not just fill the current need
	- Besides technical skills, I also look for candidates with strong ownership, accountability, product thinking, and growth mindset
2. **Identify ideal candidate profile**
	- Align with the company/product/team strategy and goals
	- Clear expectations: What kind of impact do we expect this person to make?
3. **Pitch**: How to motivate the candidates to join us. What does our team/project offer.
4. **Interview plan**
	- Assemble the right hiring committee
	- Set consistent bar and remove bias: Calibrated rubrics, shadowing for consistency, structured debriefs
	- Train the interviewers
	- Align on the process
	- E.g. I want the PM and PD to be involved
5. **Help recruiter source the best candidates**
	- Clearly communicate ICP to the recruiter
	- Reach out to my internal network
	- Niche communities (e.g. open-source contributors)
6. **Evaluate results and improved**
	- Time-to-fill
	- Numbers (funnel)
	- Quality of hires
	- Retention rates

## [TODO, Meta] How do you measure success of an engineering team?
TODO

## Fix an unhealthy team

1. Root cause analysis
    * Use data and feedback to figure out what is really happening.
    * Get everyone's perspectives.
    * How am I contributing to this? (own it)
2. Set the standards and norms - what behavior is considered good performance and the opposite
    * Value diverse thinking. Evaluate different solutions. Critical thinking over consensus.
    * E.g. challenge ideas, behaviors, impact - not personalities
    * Stick to the facts
    * How do we provide feedback
    * ...
3. Create action plan
    * E.g. workshops
4. Execute
    * I am an active contributor to this
        * Lead by example
        * Help resolve conflicts
        * Encourage participation in debates

# Project/product execution

## Defining goals and setting expectations

TODO: _Core of People Management_, _Coursera_

## How do you balance between business and developer needs (e.g. removing tech debt)?

All departments within the company should have a common goal. The item in question somehow affects that goal (if not, than there is probably no need for communicating about it), whether directly or indirectly. In communication with the business people, **I present the information in terms of how it affects that goal, which is a "universal, cross-department unit of measurement"**. In my experience, that makes the path to agreement or disagreement much simpler.

Let's say that common goal is the profit. Then I would present the information as something like "_This is going to cost us $X. It is going to save up X% of time to our developers, thus speeding up our development by X%. This will result in releasing the feature X months earlier, which will result in X% increase in profit._"

## How do you fill in for yourself when going to vacation?

Senior team member:
* Work with PM on milestone plannings and refinements
* New members onboarding

My manager (HoE):
* Manager approvals (e.g. access to staging)
* Financial stuff
* People management

## How do you validate hypothesis?

* Data from our existing product and usage
* Speaking to customers
* Surveys
* Prototypes, wireframes (if cost-efficient)
* Demographic research
* A/B testing (if cost-efficient)

<br />

## MVP

* The minimum set of functionalities that will allow us to validate our hypothesis.
* This set of functionalities is decided based on:
    * Market research
    * Cost effectiveness
        * How easy it is to build certain functionality?
        * Is it monetisable?
    * Company strategy
* Characteristics
    * Feedback-able
    * Flexible, easy to adapt and iterate based on customer feedback

## How do you approach experimentation

1. Goal - what problem are we trying to solve and how it impacts our users?
2. Hypothesis
    * "_We believe that [a solution] will [the change that will happen] for [audience segment] because [reason for change]._"
3. Metrics - KPIs
    * Conversion rate from free trial to paid subscription
    * Form completion time
    * Form completion rate
    * Churn rate
4. Experiment parameters
    * Sample
        * size
        * demographics
        * ...
    * Duration
5. Run the experiment
    * A/B, multivariate...
    * Tools: Laquesis, Google Optimize, Hotjar
6. Review results
    * Success: Roll it out to 100% of users
    * Failure: Try to learn from it
