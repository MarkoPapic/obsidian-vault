## Answers

### Sergio TCC tech stack
- Docker acquired AtomicJar
- Sergio's impact lowered over time. The output was there, but the outcomes were not impactful. He started focusing his effort on tasks that are not high priority.
- Staff Engineers play a pivotal role in technical leadership, and disengagement at that level can affect both team momentum and morale.
- I talked to Sergio in our 1:1 as soon as I noticed this
	- I wanted to understand his perspective without jumping to conclusions
	- I assumed best intentions: he had previously been a strong contributor and a great leader
- Root cause: tech stack, architecture, no staging
- While his concerns were valid, I explained that:
	- These things are common in the software industry - companies acquire other companies
	- Staff Software Engineers are expected to lead through them, not avoid them. His role required him to help bridge the gap between the two systems, not opt out of the hard parts.
	- Making the new codebase work with our existing codebase is crucial for our product strategy.
-  We aligned on the above expectations and together came up with an improvement plan
	- Sergio pair with Kiril
	- I secured a short-term help from Infra
- Sergio committed to leading the effort and viewed it as an opportunity to influence the architecture instead of being frustrated by it.
- Over the following months, I checked in frequently and helped with minor moments of friction
- Sergio became re-engaged, and took ownership of the integration work. Not only he made it work, but also suggested and implemented some ideas for future-proofing (e.g. time-series database for insights)
- His impact returned to the expected Staff Engineer level and the knowledge he applied was allowed other engineers to learn from it
- My learnings:
	- Even senior/staff engineers can get hesitant to take ownership and make changes, and feel as the situation was imposed top-down
	- It is important to act early and encourage the bottoms-up approach - suggesting changes and taking ownership and accountability for them

### Michalis - laid off
He underperformed in the following ways:
- Tasks he worked on took too long - way longer than expected, given the complexity of the tasks.
- He didn't provide any visibility or transparency into his work.
- He frequently missed meetings without notice. Then he retroactively says that he had to pick up a kid from school.
- When I manage to get a hold of him to discuss the progress of his tasks, he says that it is taking that long because he is doing thorough research before implementing a solution.
- When he finally delivers, the solution is usually low quality, which is contradictory to the amount of research he claims he has been doing.
- He showed no proactivity. When out of work, he would wait for me to explicitly give him something to work on.
In our 1:1 meetings, I brought these things up and tried to get to the root cause together with him, without jumping to conclusions. He was cooperative in these conversations and we came up with a 30-day performance improvement plan. Key elements included:
- Improving visibility:
	- Better Jira hygiene - I provided some examples
	- Standups - sharing more information
	- Writing design docs - sharing his intentions with the rest of the team
- Calendar hygiene: I understand if he has to pick up a kid from school, but I advised him to block these time slots in the calendar ahead of time so that the rest of the team is aware that he will be unavailable
- Tasks are taking too long due to the apparent research he is doing: Writing design docs (as mentioned above) was supposed to address this, too, giving the rest of the team visibility into his intentions, as well as allowing them to give feedback.
- Ownership and proactivity: Being proactive about choosing priority tasks or reaching out tome when unsure.
- Quality improvement: I also arranged pair programming sessions with more experienced engineers, with the intention of improving the quality of his deliverables.

He committed to the above improvement plan, and I documented it and shared it with him.

I documented the plan and tracked progress regularly. While there was some temporary improvement, the same patterns returned. Tasks dragged, visibility dropped, and quality remained low.

In the meantime, we had a formal, company-wide performance review where I also shared feedback with him, indicating that his performance is below expectations. In this formal review, his peers also shared similar reviews about him.

After 60 days with minimal improvement, I consulted HR. We extended the PIP with more intensive support and I kept close contact with HR to ensure fairness and remove potential bias.

After more than 90+ days of support and no meaningful, sustained improvement, I made the decision to let him go. Otherwise, his continuous underperforming would hurt:
- Delivery velocity
- Team morale and coordination

### 1-1s
- **Execution and delivery** (not status updates)
    - Are they clear on priorities and expectations?
	- Are they aware of how their work ties into the goals?
	- Any blockers?
	    - Cross-functional dependencies I could resolve?
		- Something I could escalate?
- **Career growth** (not every time)
    - Review development plan
	- Are they on a good path towards the next role - referencing the competence framework
	- Are their current projects helping them grow (challenging, new skills, ...)
- **Coaching and feedback**
    - Share feedback
	- Ask what feedback they have for me
- **Well-being and morale**
    - Do they feel their work is meaningful and impactful
	- Do they feel they have a safe environment and autonomy to innovate
	- Any stress, burnout, etc.
- **Recent changes**
    - Share latest changes
	- Discuss recent changes
	- How do they feel about the changes
- **Team dynamics and culture**
    - Any shoutouts?
	- Any conflicts?
	- Do they feel confident to share ideas/concerns/...?
- **Ideas / improvement areas**
    - What could we be doing better as a team?
- **How can I help?**

### Silvin promotion
Great IC, great potential. Other engineers already learning from him.
- **Task**: I wanted to provide an environment for him where he can
	- Make impact
	- Expand his influence XT and XFN
	- Stay engaged
- **Establish goals**:
	- Goal: become a Staff Engineer
	- Went over the competence framework
		- Mapped strengths and improvement areas
		- Aligned on them
- **Plan**: Stretch goal - Own a billing service
	- Requires a lot of XFN collaboration with the PM, Billing team, RevRec team
	- Requires ownership and accountability
	- Opportunity to mentor other engineers
	- We set expected outcomes, not outputs: autonomy
- **Coaching and sponsorship**: weekly follow-ups in our 1:1s and other meetings
	- XFN enablement: Ensuring prioritization and engineering resources from the Billing team
	- Coached him on delegating to the Billing team
	- Coached him on defining ownership and strong API contracts
	- Coached him on proactively reaching to the Billing team so that they can put it on the roadmap
	- Coached him on framing proposals in terms of outcomes and business value, not just technical design
	- Invited him to present at a meeting with VPs of prod/eng. Coached him on how to frame it in terms of outcomes, not outputs.
	- Safeguards against burnout - I kept a close eye on workload distribution, making sure he wasn’t the “go-to” for every critical issue. I paired him with one mid-level engineer and one junior engineer to delegate some of the load.
- **Evaluate and tweak**: We review the outcomes weekly
	- Customer value
	- Delivery velocity
	- Engineering metrics
	- After a XT/XFN meeting, I'd go over it with him: what worked? where did pushback land? what was crucial in reaching consensus?
- **Result**:
	- More people are aware of his influence
	- He got some public shoutouts/kudos
	- VP of eng supported his promotion
	- He got promoted
- **Reflection/learnings**
	- High performers need both challenge and sponsorhip
	- If you don't stretch them, they disengage. If you just pile work on them, they can burn out.
	- The sweet spot is giving them opportunities that expand their impact, giving them ownership, making their work visible, and ensuring they feel supported.

### Alberto Buildkit contributor
* **Situation**:
	* Works on making Buildkit work in cloud.
	* Spends time understanding and troubleshooting Buildkit codebase.
	* In our planning sessions, Alberto usually acts frustrated about how he will spend another 2 weeks troubleshooting Buildkit.
* **Task**:
	* Help Alberto not get disengaged
	* Get more support from the Buildkit team
* **Talk to Alberto**
	* He feels like he can only do 1 task while other engineers do 3 because he needs to understand Buildkit internals. This is a side effect that slows him down and he doesn't feel like he gets recognition for that.
* **Talk to Tonis**
	* Build team doesn't have enough resources to help us. They have a large influx of public issues. They cannot risk a decade of reputation with a multi-milion user base.
	* Even they could use more maintainers.
* **My idea**: Alberto becomes a Buildkit maintainer (win-win-win)
	* Alberto's side-effect work is not a waste anymore. It is a valuable skill for the Build team that will ultimately lead to a recognition (maintainer).
	* Tonis gets a new skilled maintainer
	* Our product reinforces our UVP
* **Talk to Alberto again**
	* He is thrilled about the idea
* **Plan**:
	* Alberto spends 10% of his time working with the Build team.
	* He becomes a Buldkit maintainer within next year
	* Build team provides support to Alberto
* **Sponsorship**:
	* Follow ups with the Build team ensuring that they are engaging him in a meaningful way
	* Follow ups with Alberto ensuring that he is engaged in a meaningful way
* **Evaluate**:
	* Ensure Alberto's delivery velocity doesn't drop more than agreed 10%
* **Result**:
	* Alberto is engaged
	* Instead of being frustrated with having to dig deep into Bulidkit codebase, now he is excited to do it because it gets him closer to being a maintainer
* **Reflection/learnings**:
	* Something that seems like a bi-product (waste), can be valuable for some other team, and I should seek those win-win situations

### Tiago feeling left out
* **Context**: Tiago was the Big Brother on that project.
* **Symptoms**: Lack of communication with Luis (mid-level). Stopped contributing to their ideas. Luis noticed this and stopped involving Tiago.
* **Open (1:1)**:
	* **Identify**: "Hey, I've noticed that you don't contribute to Luis' ideas in our recent meetings"
	* **Explain impact**: "This may start to have a negative impact on our brainstorming sessions.  If you don't exchange ideas, our decision-making is going to degade."
* **Clarify causes**:
	* **Ask about root cause**: It was because Luis and Luis left him out when designing a feature.
	* **Empathy**: "You feel like your influence decreased. That has to be frustrating."
	* **Connect to a shared goal**: "You both want this project to succeed"
	* **Help them understand other person's perspective**:
		* "*Why do you think they left you out from that feature?*"
		* "_If you were looking at this situation from (name’s) perspective, what would you see? How might you feel?_"
		* "*How you might be contributing to this conflict?*"
* **Coach part 1**:
	* Explained to Tiago that he should own this conflict and bring it out in the open sooner rather than later.
	* He should try to get to the root cause together with Luis.
	* "How can I help?"
* **Coach part 2**: Tiago found out that Luis felt like they bother Tiago too much
	*  "_How would you define a win-win in this situation?_": Async RFQs.
	* "*If you could do one thing to resolve this conflict, what would it be?*"
* **Commit to action**
	* Tiago will propose an internal RFQ process
	* I will review it
	* He will share it with the whole team
* **Result**
	* Tiago proposed an internal RFQ process. I helped shape it (e.g. not everything needs to be an RFQ; "requires consensus" checkbox)
* **Reflection/learning**: There is a sweet spot with high-performers:
	* If they are a go-to person for everything, it can be distracting for them and they can even burn out
	* If they are not a go-to person, they feel an empty nest syndrome
