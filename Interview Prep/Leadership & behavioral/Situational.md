| Managing underperformer 1                  | Forrest works on rabbit holes, not making tangible impact to our product strategy.<br>- I asked why does he work on that so much? Does this motivate him more?<br>- His answer: Not necessarily, but while he waits to be told what to do, he works on chasing down these rabbit holes.<br>- He helped me realize: He is not bought in on our strategy; he lacks accountability.<br>- I reiterated on our strategy and goals (the "why") but this time I ensured that he understands it and encouraged him to probe it and suggest improvements. Now he is more bought in as he feels like he contributed to the strategy. I encouraged him to do this probing proactively.<br>- I ensured that he clearly understands our success metrics.<br>- I told him that we are all accountable for these metrics and he should not wait to be told what to do.<br>- I follow up with him frequently and ask how his work ties into our goals (I even created a Lattice template).<br>- Result: His impact has improved and he is proactively engaged in work that matters. He feels like this work is meaningful now. |
