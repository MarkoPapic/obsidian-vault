## Why people management?

Two reasons:
* Helping people grow; enabling them to become a top performer is one of the best feelings in the world.
* In order to deliver a great product, you need to have a high-performing team. I can make a much bigger impact by building a great team, than by doing it on my own.

## Management style

Some of the most important characteristics that I need to build, and that my team needs to see in me are:
* Credibility
    * They are confident that I have the knowledge, skills and experience to lead them
* Reliability
    * I give my best not to break promises. And when I do, I own it:
        * I am transparent, I communicate it in a timely manner.
        * I do my best to learn from it and prevent it from happening again.
* Trust
    * They trust that I have their best interest in mind.

This allow me to build high-performers and help them grow, because they are confident at any moment that I have their best interest in mind and that I can help them. E.g. when providing them with constructive feedback, they know that it is growth opportunity and not criticism.
Besides that, I am also a manager who is pretty involved and aligned with the product team and the stakeholders. Short-term strategy, long-term strategy, product analytics... I like to have a big picture, which also helps me bring that vision closer to my team, unify them around that vision, and make their work feel more meaningful.

## People growth (development, coaching)

1. **Identify** - What do we need to develop?
    * Strengths, weaknesses, challenges, opportunities
    * Aspirations
        * _Where do you want to be in 5m/1y/5y_?
        * _What skills do you need to get there?_ (maybe assess against the competence matrix)
        * _What does your team need from you to be successful? How are you meeting these needs today? How might you better fulfill those needs tomorrow?_
        * _How can I help?_
    * Company strategy
    * Look for the greatest value (ROI) - E.g. you may find it interesting to research best practices on internal communication systems, but improving communication between external customers and internal staff may produce a much higher return on investment by increasing client retention and sales.
2. Establish **goals & plan** (IDP)
    * Goals
        * _What are the most important activities you should be spending your time on right now? How do these activities create value?_
        * _What inhibits you from doing more of the things you believe you should be doing? How might you minimize non-productive work?_
    * Plan
        * 70:20:10
3. Execute
    * **Learn by doing** (with my support)
        * This is the major aspect of learning
        * I try to provide the environment which allows for developmental experiences.
        * I support them without removing responsibility
        * When defining goals, I think about whether those goals are  focused on fixed performance, or can they also be developmental experiences? Note: This is individual. What is a routine for someone, might be a challenge for someone else.
        * IDP question: “_What are two experiences in the next job you want to be in that you could try now?_”
        * **Delegation**
        * **Sponsoring** - enabling them to have those developmental experiences that I mentioned.
    * **Learn by failing**
        * Retrospectives - make every failure a developmental experience
    * Nurture a **growth mindset**
    * (if they ask) What does make an experience developmental:
        * Novel - getting out of routine.
        * Important
        * Diverse thinking - exposes the person to diverse ways of thinking, feeling and acting.
    * Learn by **interacting** with me
        * Observing them in action
        * Listening to them
        * Helping them
        * Providing feedback
    * Learn from **education**
        * The company provides plenty of materials
        * Conferences
4. **Evaluate and tweak**
    * It is a cyclic process


## Building trust

TODO: "Trust is a must" and other stuff from _Core of People Management_.
TODO: Fulfilling promisses (if not implicated by the above)
TODO: There is a _Share thoughts, feelings, and rationale (to build trust)_ section in _CoPM → Communication_.

## Handling mistakes of your team members

1. Determine the root cause
2. Prevent it from happening again

When it comes to tolerance:
* I align this with company strategy. E.g. if you want to encourage inovation, you gotta have some tolerance for mistakes.
* I personally have a high tolerance to mistakes, as long as they are exceptions. If it becomes an ongoing repetition of underperforming, then it can't actually be categorized as a mistake and I address it in a different way.

## Delivering feedback

TODO: Core of People Management
TODO: Coursera
TODO: All this might already be summarized in your people management guide

## How do you do performance reviews?

TODO: You can do this better now. Use your _People manager guide_ and _Engagement Plan_ from OLX

1. **Evaluation**:
    * Make sure the person is aware (reach an agreement).
    * Objective, data-driven, specific.
2. **Improvement plan**:
    * Come up with a clear improvement plan.
    * Try to temporally separate `evaluation` and `improvement plan`
        * When a person receives critical feedback in a tough performance review, they often activate a self-protection mechanism - they stop listening. Might not be the best idea to try and be constructive regarding improvements, while they are in that mode.
3. **Motivation**: Make sure the employee leaves the performance appraisal more motivated.
4. **Follow up**
    * Positive reinforcement when seeing desired changes.
    * Further actions (next steps towards firing) if no improvement noticed.

## Managing high performers

* Agree on the next position for that person (career trajectory)
* Growth plan - it is my (and company's) responsibility to provide them with an environment where they can make impact
	* Give them something to own
	* Challenges, stretch goals
	* Expand their influence: collaboration
	* Mentoring opportunities: allow them to duplicate themselves
* Keep them challenged, but avoid burnout
    * High performers tend to become "goto" people (e..g. other CUs pinging Tiago)
* Provide positive feedback/recognition (a proper feedback, not flattering)
* Find what motivates them
* Follow up regularly

## Managing underperformers

TODO: From _Core of People Management_
* Make sure they know I have their best interest in mind
* Communication
* Delivering feedback

## Managing conflict

Note: _Probably briefly go over the below outline, and then get into details of each item_

* **Prevention**: establishing some norms and ground rules
    * Encourage debates. Make them a common thing rather than an exception
        * This will, over time, make people less likely to take criticism personally
    * Establish a norm where we focus on ideas, behaviors and impact - but not personalities
    * Establish a norm where debates are resolved by referencing facts, assumptions… not by power of the loudest voice
* **Observing without getting involved**
    * Disagreement: different ideas, approaches, or points of view can promote creativity and innovation. This is encouraged, people should not avoid disagreement and debate.
    * At this point I don't get involved, just stay alert in case I notice some signs like:
        * Disagreement shifted focus from task to personal
        * It is an ongoing disagreement and they are failing to reach the conclusion
* **Recognize** the warning signs of escalation
    * Focus on personalities
    * Poor communication
    * Pointed disagreements
    * Lack of openness
    * Negative body language
    * Dissatisfaction
    * Increased stress
    * Inflamatory words or actions
* **Address early**: I believe it is important to address the conflict as soon as it stops being constructive (as soon as I notice those warning signs I mentioned). When I address the conflict:
    * I try to avoid mediation at first, and try to help them to use their skills to resolve the conflict on their own.
    * And I only become a mediator if they are not able to resolve it or don't have the neccessary skills to do so
* **Coaching** people on how to resolve the conflict. I try to encourage them to take the ownership of the conflict, and help them come up with ideas and a plan for resolving the conflict. So I am mostly asking questions, and only give advise if needed (if they don't have the necessary skills to resolve the conflict)
    1. **Open** - identify the conflict and its impact.
        * Describe the purpose of our discussion, and importance.
            * _Hey, I've noticed that you and (name) don't communicate much in our recent meetings. And that concerns because this is starting to have a negative impact on our brainstorming sessions. If you don't exchange ideas, we might end up making a decision that is not optimal._
    2. **Clarify** causes of conflict
        * Ask them about the root cause.
        * Also show empathy with how they feel about this conflict
            * _What do you think is the root cause of this situation, and how are you feeling about it?_
            * _You fell like your ideas are being ignored. That has to be frustrating._
        * Focus on behaviors, ideas, impact... - not personalities
            * _What exactly in (name's) behavior makes you feel that way? What are the examples of (name's) behaviors?_
            * _What assumptions are you making, and how can you challenge them?_
        * Connect to a shared goal
            * _What goals or objectives do you and (name) share, and how would you describe them?_
            * _What are the potential benefits in how you and (name) are different?_
        * Help them try to understand the other person's perspective
            * _If you were looking at this situation from (name’s) perspective, what would you see? How might you feel?_
            * _How might you be contributing to this conflict?_
    3. Help **develop** ideas for resolving the conflict
        * By asking questions
        * Contribute ideas if needed
            * _How would you define a win-win in this situation?_
            * _If you could do one thing to resolve this conflict, what would it be?_
            * _How might you involve (name) in resolving this situation?_
            * _How would (name) feel about or react to this solution? How might you respond?_
            * _What might you say to acknowledge the other person’s point of view and feelings?_
            * _What would be the positive and negative consequences of taking this action? What would be the consequences of taking no action?)_
            * **_What resources/support can I provide?_**
    4. **Commit to action**
        * Create a plan for resolving the conflict
        * Specify how to track progress and measure results
    5. **Close**
        * Summarize the plan
        * Confirm understanding
        * Express confidence in their skills to resolve this conflict
        * Confirm committment
* **Mediation** - if conflict is still unresolved or starts causing damage
    * Set ground rules
        * Ask the people involved to agree on some do’s and don’ts for how they will treat each other during the discussion to ensure it is constructive.
    * Stay neutral, objective and unbiased
        * Stay focused on the facts
        * Empathize without agreeing
        * Check frequently for mutual understanding
    * Encourage everyone's involvement
        * Give everyone equal time to express themselves
        * Encourage people to restate the other person’s perspective to confirm understanding before moving on.
    * Connect everyone to a shared goal
    * Help people take ownership for resolving the conflict
        * Make it clear that your role is to help them discuss their differences constructively and that it is their responsibility to resolve the conflict.
        * Contribute ideas


BONUS: What about **zero-sum** conflicts?
* Transform conflict into a negotiation.
    * By adding other issues to negotiation and making trade-offs across those issues.
    * People can value various issues differently.
    * _“I will do this for you if you do such-and-such for me”_

# Project/product execution

## Defining goals and setting expectations

TODO: _Core of People Management_, _Coursera_

## How do you balance between business and developer needs (e.g. removing tech debt)?

All departments within the company should have a common goal. The item in question somehow affects that goal (if not, than there is probably no need for communicating about it), whether directly or indirectly. In communication with the business people, **I present the information in terms of how it affects that goal, which is a "universal, cross-department unit of measurement"**. In my experience, that makes the path to agreement or disagreement much simpler.

Let's say that common goal is the profit. Then I would present the information as something like "_This is going to cost us $X. It is going to save up X% of time to our developers, thus speeding up our development by X%. This will result in releasing the feature X months earlier, which will result in X% increase in profit._"

## How do you fill in for yourself when going to vacation?

Senior team member:
* Work with PM on milestone plannings and refinements
* New members onboarding

My manager (HoE):
* Manager approvals (e.g. access to staging)
* Financial stuff
* People management

## How do you validate hypothesis?

* Data from our existing product and usage
* Speaking to customers
* Surveys
* Prototypes, wireframes (if cost-efficient)
* Demographic research
* A/B testing (if cost-efficient)

<br />

## MVP

* The minimum set of functionalities that will allow us to validate our hypothesis.
* This set of functionalities is decided based on:
    * Market research
    * Cost effectiveness
        * How easy it is to build certain functionality?
        * Is it monetisable?
    * Company strategy
* Characteristics
    * Feedback-able
    * Flexible, easy to adapt and iterate based on customer feedback

## How do you approach experimentation

1. Goal - what problem are we trying to solve and how it impacts our users?
2. Hypothesis
    * "_We believe that [a solution] will [the change that will happen] for [audience segment] because [reason for change]._"
3. Metrics - KPIs
    * Conversion rate from free trial to paid subscription
    * Form completion time
    * Form completion rate
    * Churn rate
4. Experiment parameters
    * Sample
        * size
        * demographics
        * ...
    * Duration
5. Run the experiment
    * A/B, multivariate...
    * Tools: Laquesis, Google Optimize, Hotjar
6. Review results
    * Success: Roll it out to 100% of users
    * Failure: Try to learn from it

## Example of an experiment

### Chasis number (VIN) check

**Hypothesis**: If we add a first step in the posting form for sellers to introduce the chasis number (VIN), then drop rate in the posting form will be reduced because sellers will leverage the decoding services to automatically fill the information and they will not be as overwhelmed with the posting form.

**Why?** User Drop rate during the posting flow varies between 29 - 38% across the three markets.

**Business success criteria**: Reduce the User Drop Rate in the posting form for C2C sellers.

**Health metrics**:
* B2C Posting Form Drop Rate
* B2C Posting Form Drop Rate
* C2C Posting Form Drop Rate
* Time to complete the Posting Form

**User segment**: Random 25%

### CEPIK verification

**Hypothesis**: If we ask sellers for permission to use their data to validate the ad details against Cepik data, then sellers will give the data and the permission, because they want to have a badge of “certified” car in their ad.

**Why?**: EU Car Verticals wants to be a trusted partner to both buyers and sellers. However currently there are a few challenges, one being the information asymmetry. The seller know much more about the car than the buyer. According to this study, 78% of the interviewed buyers included the Car Condition and 72% the Accident and Damage History in their top 5 concerns about a used car.

**Business success criteria**:
* % of sellers that agree to verify their data against Cepik data
* Coverage of VIN + First Registration Date + License Plate

**Health metrics**:
* B2C Posting Form Conversion Rate [Event]
* C2C Posting Form Conversion Rate [Event]

**User segment**: Random 25%

## Incident management

TODO

# Misc

## Collaboration example

### OLX - UX research collaboration

**Nugget**: Collaborated with the UX research team to increase the adoption of our product among Car Parts sellers.
**Situation**:
- Car Parts sellers have huge inventories (hundreds of thousands, some of them over a million).
- But they only post a few thousands adverts to our platforms.
- The adoption of P&S was low <1% of inserted adverts
**Actions**:
- Reached out to UX research team asking if I could provide some hypothesis that they could try and validate with our customers. My hypothesis were:
	- They don’t post their inventories because of the lack of API that would allow them to import their inventories in a programmatic way
	- The main challenge with using P&S was inventory synchronisation
- Both hypothesis were confirmed by the customers
- I created a plan on how to solve those challenges
- I brought together product and stakeholders and presented the plan to them
- I got the green light
- We build an API, which also supports 2-way communication (webhooks)
**Result**:
- Number of Car Parts adverts insertions increased by 15% to >10M
- Number of adverts with P&S increased by 300% (from 1% to 3%)

## Stakeholder management and influence

### OLX - Flexible Parts pricing

**Nugget**: Increased the adoption of our product among Car Parts sellers by negotiating with the stakeholders about adding a new monetisation plan.
**Situation**: Got the data from our UX researchers that the customers don’t import their whole inventories because of inflexible pricing.
**Actions**:
- Brought together product team and stakeholders (local markets) and proposed a new monetisation plan, which would allow:
    - volume discount
    - subcategory pricing
- Implemented new pricing management functionality that also offers the admin portal (UI) that allows the local markets (stakeholders) to configure pricing, packages, discounts… themselves.
**Result**:
- This increased the number of insertions more than all previous initiatives combined (by 50%)

### OLX - Taxonomy changes breaking API users

**Situation**: Taxonomy is dynamic and business people can modify it via UI. This automatically gets visible in the UI (posting form, filtering). This is great for UI, but it breaks our API users.
**Action**: I defined the breaking changes, and we agreed that before making a breaking change, it needs to be aligned with the engineering team.
