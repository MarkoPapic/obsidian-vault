Hi Gianni,

Thank you again for walking me through the offer and for your support throughout the process. I’m very excited about the opportunity and can clearly see myself thriving in Yiannis’ team.

After reviewing the package, I was hoping we could make a few adjustments to reflect what I’d be leaving behind at Docker:
* Increase the base salary to **£150K**
* Increase the equity grant to **$800K**
* Add a **£30K** sign-on bonus

My main reasons are:
* My current salary is higher than the base offered by Meta.
* I’ll be giving up my end-of-year bonus.
* I’m on track for a promotion this year, which would increase both scope and comp.
* I’ll also be forfeiting unvested RSUs. While Docker is not yet public, the company is on a strong trajectory toward IPO or acquisition, so those RSUs carry meaningful potential upside.

If we can move closer to these numbers, I’d be very comfortable moving forward quickly. I’m genuinely excited about joining Meta and contributing to the team’s mission.

Best regards,
Marko
