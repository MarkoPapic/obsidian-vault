## From Meta

Preliminary numbers (not official):
* Base: £139K (€160K)
* Performance bonus: 20% £27.8K (€32K)
	* Can be multiplied by individual and company performance
* Equity: 600K$ vesting over 4 years (in dollars)
	* $150Kper year (€127K)
* Equity refreshes: every year you can get an equity refresh (even for average performance)
* Relocation package: once we have an offer finalized

This would make a total yearly compensation: 

Reasons they will move from these:
* You want more money
	* Gianni is here to tell me what's realistic
* You've got a competing offer
	* Gianni can use this as a leverage
* Unvested stocks
	* Docker's stock options are a data point
	* But the finances will push back since it is not public
* What you have vesting over the next 12 months

Data points that don't work:
* Taxes
* Cost of living
* ...

* Bonus:
	* For Gianni: **€40K**

## Research

- **Base:**
	- ChatGPT:  £145–150K
	- Glassdoor: £135–153K
	- Levels.fyi: £151K
- **Equity:**
	- ChatGPT: $700K–800K
	- Levels.fyi: £1.1M
- **Sign-on bonus:**
	- They haven’t mentioned one yet. Meta often offers £30K–£70K+ in sign-on for managers. This is a big missing piece you can ask for.
- **Relocation:** Often useful, but not a true substitute for comp — so you can use relocation as a _reason_ to ask for more sign-on.

## Negotiation data points

* Base salary is lower than my current salary
* I am expecting a promotion
* I am expecting a yearly bonus
* I will be giving up RSUs

## My counter-offer

* **Base**: £150
* **Equity**: $800
* **Sign-on bonus**: £30K

## Script

*Thanks for walking me through the package. It’s a strong offer, and I appreciate the breakdown.*

*That said, in order to make the transition worthwhile given what I’d be leaving behind at Docker, I was hoping we could adjust the package slightly. Specifically:*  
* *Increase the base salary to **£150K***  
* *Increase the equity grant to **$800K over 4 years***  
* *Add a **£30K sign-on bonus***

*The main reasons are:*
* *My current salary is higher than the base offered by Meta.*
* *I’ll be giving up my end-of-year bonus.*
* *I’m on track for a promotion this year, which would increase both scope and comp.*
* *I’ll also be forfeiting unvested RSUs. While Docker is not yet public, the company is on a strong trajectory toward IPO or acquisition, so those RSUs carry meaningful potential upside.*

*I know there are limits to flexibility, but if we can move closer to these numbers, I’d be very comfortable moving forward quickly. I’m genuinely excited to join the team and want to make sure the package reflects the value of making this transition.*
