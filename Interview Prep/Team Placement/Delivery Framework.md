[[#About me]]

**Acknowledge the phase & frame the conversation as mutual fit**
I know this stage is about seeing where there’s a strong mutual fit. I’d love to hear more about the team, and how I could help drive both impact and growth here.

**Set collaborative tone**
I’m also happy to share more about my approach to people leadership, execution, and how I partner with peers — whatever would be most useful for you in this conversation.


## About me
I come from a technical background  - I’ve been coding since I was 15 and have a degree in Computer Science. Over the years, I’ve worked across a range of domains like FinTech, EdTech, and developer tooling, and in environments ranging from early-stage startups to large enterprises. Right now, I’m an Engineering Manager at Docker, where I lead the development of Docker Cloud - a SaaS platform that enables developers to build, run, and test their software seamlessly in the cloud. The platform is currently live, scaling up to more than 2M cloud runs per day, bringing more than 50% of Docker net new product revenue. And that’s the kind of challenge I love - building highly scalable products impacting millions of users, and what excites me about Meta is the chance to take that impact from millions to billions of users.
