## Consider to buy
- Google (ABEC or ABEA):
	- Their price is currently the same as last year
	- They acquired Waymo
- Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)
	- They are low now because Warren Buffer stepped away, but it's not like he stepped away today, he is 90y old.
- Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG)
	- **Not immediately, wait for a dip**
	- They produce different kinds of energy (electrical, gas), including renewable and nuclear sources
	- There is a hype around AI but what is going to power this AI?
- BYD (BY6.F or 1211.HK)
	- **Maybe best to wait for the tariff pause to end, because that may affect BYD**
	- They dropped recently and are quite low now


Google: 500
Berkshire Hathaway: 500
