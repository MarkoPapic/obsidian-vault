Colorado Springs built their own controller software and ATMS. It was a 15yo software and all of the engineers who worked on it retired, except Dan, who is 56yo and is about soon to retire.

Dan wants to open-source this. He gave Sasa access to GitHub: https://github.com/TOAD-Traffic-Management-Software/ISM

The leadership from back in the days probably had some reason to decide to 

Their ATMS: Old C++ Borland, Dan doesn't want to maintain it anymore.

They want to keep their controller software but buy a new ATMS.
