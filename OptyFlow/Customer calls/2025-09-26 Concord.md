**Questions for Concord**
* Intersection vs signal (is it safe to treat them as 1-1)
* Timing types and flags in version history
* Controller time controls & synchronization
* Events & alerts

## Feedback on current usage
* No feedback atm

## Wireshark
* Timestamps: 16:38-16:39

## Timing types and flags in version history

* In Centracs, they use timing plans for different timing types. E.g. plan 52 is an incident plan.
	* If we could assign a "tag" to a **timing plan**, that would be handy
* When ti comes to 

## Controller actions & controls
* An elegant way to do controls in bulk (to multiple controllers) would be great
	* E.g. have multiple signals in the list and *advance* through them one by one, while still seeing the status
* DB level: tags would be useful
* DB reverts are rare

### My takeaways
* We should not enforce too much structure because:
	* Even free text description in the version name works for them
	* They didn't have give much feedback on what would those tags look like
