Agenda
- [ ] New features (see backlog)
- [ ] Field intersection fix - check HTTP endpoint: `curl http://192.168.1.33:1025/maxtime/api/mibs/databaseName`
- [ ] Job panicked
	- [ ] Controller ID: `3`

Bug: OptyFlow keeps putting ASC3 controller in RemoteAdvance (manual advance). Even if communication is `Disabled`. Controller ID is 3.

Bulk controls:
* Coordination pattern
* Put multiple intersections in flash
* Change sequencing at the same time (lead -> lag): set active sequence
	* What if sequences are different? Just use the "presek"
* Setting time
No bulk:
* Manual mode

Change:  `Sequences` widget to `Ring structure`

We need to display how much time the intersection has been in a  specific interval, e.g. it has been in green for 45 seconds. It is referred to as **actual time** (and there is also *programmed time* so that you can see actual vs programmed) At the moment, we only show how much time is left (count down) TODO: Clarify with Sasa

Granular upload HTTP API: The port was wrong. It was actually port 80.
