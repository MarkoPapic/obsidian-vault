At some point, you get to a situation where you have so much alerts that people start ignoring them.

Challenge 1: Have alerts without overwhelming.

Main alerts:
* Signal went to flash
* Communication failure
* Preempt
	* But they don't need to know about every preempt in the city
	* Maybe in a way "if it is active for N minutes" or if it happens to frequent

It would be good to be able to summarize multiple alerts over time and extract information from them. As a Director, Josh may be interested in that. E.g.: we've had cycle failure on a regular basis and that can guide us towards identifying issue in our configuration.

Josh likes audio alerts. So that operators don't need to keep looking at the UI constantly. Even an option to configure custom audio (e.g. MP3) for each alert.
