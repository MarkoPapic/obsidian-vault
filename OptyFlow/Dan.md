**Sasa's offer to Dan**:
* 10 years at 30% of each firmware license sale (min $200)
* Optional
	* Promissory note for services rendered of $50000 per year
		* But for this, we would need a 10h/week commitment for 5 years

**My suggestions**
* ISM brand pros/cons
* Percentage of what?
* We need to build the agreement around Dan's know-how, not ISM
* We need an escape hatch
	* What if we completely replace his code?
	* We need to have a buyout clause at any time. What if Dan becomes unreasonable and obstructs the sale?
