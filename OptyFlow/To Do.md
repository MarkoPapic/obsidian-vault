- [x] On frequency should "reset" after the trigger has happened. Currently if "5 in 1 minute" we fire an alert on 6, 7, 8, etc. 
- [x] On duration should also reset (e.g. if "active for 5" triggered it, 6th minute should not trigger it)
- [x] Boolean algebra for triggers
- [x] Feature flags fix
- [x] UI: Don't allow to choose trigger type until they select an event type. Not all trigger types apply to all event types.
- [x] Use `uuid.MustParse`
- [x] Replace that expensive hash Postgres function with the other option
